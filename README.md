# Model View Controller (MVC)

MVC design pattern divides an application into three major aspects: Model, View, and Controller.

# Model

Model means data that is required to display in the view. Model represents a collection of classes that describes the business logic (business model and the data model). It also defines the business rules for data means as how the data can be changed and manipulated.

# View

The View represents UI components like XML, HTML etc. View displays the data that is received from the controller as the outcome. In MVC pattern View monitors the model for any state change and displays updated model. Model and View interact with each other using the Observer pattern.

# Controller

The Controller is responsible to process incoming requests. It processes the userâ€™s data through the Model and passing back the results to View. It normally acts as a mediator between the View and the Model.
